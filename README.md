# plox

[lox programming language](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). this whole project is a mess because i'm writing it as i read the book so it does not have the best design choices. and, uhh, i'm not good at programming.

**Note:** plox is complete with a few additions to original implementation of lox language:

* break and continue statements
* strings can be denoted with single quotes
* [native functions](https://github.com/nwxnk/plox/blob/17f6054375c75e137ffb41e96190550cae6772ec/plox/native.py): abs, pow, exit, sleep, input, clock (time.time)
